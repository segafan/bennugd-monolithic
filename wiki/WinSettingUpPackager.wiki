#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

The BennuGD Packager is a Python+Qt4 application that packages your BennuGD/Android games in an APK and, optionally, installs them to your device or an emulator. In order to get it working you need to perform a few extra steps that are detailed below. The program has been tested to work on Windows 7 64 bits but should run in other Windows versions, too.

= Prerequisites =

  * *Android SDK*
  Get it from [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html here] and install it.
  Inside the SDK, install the Android 3.2 (android-13) SDK.
  It might instruct you to install a JDK version in your system, if you don't have any.
  * *Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package*
  It's pretty common, but you might need it in systems where other programs haven't installed it.
  Get it for [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=9B2DA534-3E03-4391-8A4D-074B9F2BC1BFÂ  32bit] or [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=BD2A6171-E2D6-4230-B809-9A8D7548C1B6 64bit] Windows systems.
  * *ANT*
  The windows builds of the packager include an installer for ANT. If ANT is not yet installed in your system, you should run the provided winant-install-v7.exe before running the packager.

= Using the program =

With this you should have everything needed to use the packager. Go to the downloads section and get the latest version for windows. Download and run the BennuGD Packager.exe (no installation required)
